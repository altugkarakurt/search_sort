# Search & Sort Algorithms
A repository of standard searching and sorting algorithms. Beyond a simple refresher of fundamental algorithms, this is meant to serve as a benchmarking for general purpose techniques for speeding up Python. Each algorithm is (to be) implemented in various versions:
* `python_search_sort/` hosts the standard Python implementations (with option to parallelize)
* `cython_search_sort/` hosts the Cythonized implementations using type-declarations
* `c_search_sort/` hosts the standard library C implementations
