# Search & Sort Algorithms
A repository of standard searching and sorting algorithms. Beyond a simple refresher of fundamental algorithms, this is meant to serve as a benchmarking for general purpose techniques for speeding up Python. Each algorithm is (to be) implemented in various versions:
* `standard/` hosts the implementations with standard Python
* `parallelized/` hosts the parallelized versions of the algorithms that lend themselves to multiprocessing
* `jit/` hosts versions that are sped up using Just-In Time compilation
* `cythonized/` hosts the cythonized (and parallelized if applicable) implementations of the algorithms
